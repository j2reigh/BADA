**Role:** Senior Frontend/Data Engineer
**Task:** Create the **"Saju Knowledge Base"** file to act as the interpretation layer.

**Goal:**
We need a structured data file that maps raw Saju characters (e.g., "甲", "비견") to our App's English Archetypes and Descriptions.

**Requirements:**
1.  **File:** Create `lib/saju_constants.ts`.
2.  **Structure:** Export three large constant objects:
    -   `DAY_MASTER_MAP`: Maps 10 Heavenly Stems (甲...癸) to the "Core Identity" object.
    -   `EARTHLY_BRANCH_MAP`: Maps 12 Branches (子...亥) to the "Vibe" object.
    -   `TEN_GODS_MAP`: Maps Korean Ten Gods (비견...정인) to the "English Archetype" object.
3.  **Data Source:** Use the raw text provided below. Convert it into clean TypeScript objects.
