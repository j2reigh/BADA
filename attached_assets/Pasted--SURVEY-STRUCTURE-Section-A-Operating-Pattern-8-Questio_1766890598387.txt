## SURVEY STRUCTURE

### Section A: Operating Pattern (8 Questions)

Goal

- Multi-step survey: ONE question per page (8 steps)
- Each question is REQUIRED
- Next button is disabled until user selects an option
- Back button enabled except on step 1
- Show progress (e.g., 3/8 + progress bar)
- On final step, Next becomes "Submit"

Scoring rules (must implement exactly)

ThreatScore = score(Q1)+score(Q2)+score(Q3)

- For Q1–Q3: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0
ThreatClarity = 1 if ThreatScore >= 2 else 0

EnvironmentScore = score(Q4)+score(Q5)

- Q4: A=0, B=1, C=0.5, D=0.5
- Q5: A=0, B=1, C=1, D=0.5
Environment = 0 (Unstable) if EnvironmentScore >= 1.5 else 1 (Stable)

AgencyScore = score(Q6)+score(Q7)+score(Q8)

- For Q6–Q8: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0
Agency = 1 if AgencyScore >= 2 else 0

Type mapping table (must compute finalTypeName)
(ThreatClarity, Environment, Agency)
1,0,1 => "State Architect"
1,0,0 => "Silent Sentinel"
1,1,1 => "Master Builder"
1,1,0 => "Safe Strategist"
0,0,1 => "Fire Converter"
0,0,0 => "Emotional Drifter"
0,1,1 => "Conscious Maintainer"
0,1,0 => "Passive Floater"

Data model

- Store raw answers as letters A/B/C/D:
answers = { q1:"A", q2:"D", ... }
- On submit, compute:
threatScore, threatClarity, envScore, environment, agencyScore, agency, typeKey, finalTypeName
- typeKey format: "T{ThreatClarity}-E{Environment}-A{Agency}" (example: "T1-E0-A1")

UI requirements

- Show section title at top (Threat Response / Environment / Agency)
- Show question text and 4 selectable options (radio)
- Next disabled until selected
- Minimal, premium, mobile-first layout

### SCORING LOGIC (MANDATORY)

---

ThreatScore:
Q1–Q3:
A = +1
B/C/D = 0

ThreatClarity = 1 if ThreatScore >= 2 else 0

---

EnvironmentScore:
Q4:
A=0, B=1, C=0.5, D=0.5
Q5:
A=0, B=1, C=1, D=0.5

Environment = 0 (Unstable) if score >=1.5 else 1 (Stable)

---

AgencyScore:
Q6–Q8:
A = +1
Others = 0

Agency = 1 if AgencyScore >=2 else 0

---

### TYPE KEY GENERATION

---

Create type_key as string:

"T" + ThreatClarity

- "-E" + Environment
- "-A" + Agency

Example:
T1-E0-A1

Map to type name:

T1-E0-A1 → State Architect
T1-E0-A0 → Silent Sentinel
T1-E1-A1 → Master Builder
T1-E1-A0 → Safe Strategist
T0-E0-A1 → Fire Converter
T0-E0-A0 → Emotional Drifter
T0-E1-A1 → Conscious Maintainer
T0-E1-A0 → Passive Floater
