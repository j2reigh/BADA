# BADA (bada.one) — Full Reference

> A 5-minute self-discovery analysis that reveals how your mind actually works.

## Overview
BADA is a web-based self-discovery tool that generates personalized behavioral pattern reports. Using your birth data (date, time, and location), it performs behavioral pattern analysis to create a unique report of how you think, decide, and operate in daily life.

The report is generated by AI (Google Gemini) and delivered as a series of visual "cards" — each one covering a different aspect of your behavioral patterns.

## What BADA is NOT
- **Not fortune telling** — nothing about the future is predicted
- **Not a horoscope** — no vague daily or weekly advice
- **Not personality typing** — no putting you in a box like MBTI or Enneagram
- **Not spiritual or mystical** — framed as behavioral pattern analysis, not belief

## How it works
1. User answers 8 quick questions about their patterns
2. User enters birth date, birth time, and birth location
3. System calculates behavioral operating pattern from the birth data
4. AI generates personalized report cards based on the analysis

## FAQ

### What is BADA?
A personal report that shows how you think, decide, and operate. 3 cards free, full report for $2.9.

### How is this different from MBTI?
MBTI gives you a type. BADA maps the patterns unique to you — why you burn out, how you make decisions, what you keep repeating. No two reports are the same.

### What data do you use?
Your birth date, time, and location. From this, we calculate your behavioral operating pattern. Nothing is predicted — we show how you're wired, not what will happen.

### What do I get for $2.9?
10 more cards: why your patterns exist, what they cost you at work, in relationships, and with money, your 10-year chapter, and one thing to change this week.

### Can I access it again later?
Yes. Your report link doesn't expire. Bookmark it or check your email — we send it when your report is ready.

### Is my data safe?
Your birth data is used only to generate your report. We don't sell or share it.
