# BADA (bada.one) — Full Reference

> A 5-minute self-discovery analysis that reveals how your mind actually works.

## Overview
BADA is a web-based self-discovery tool that generates personalized behavioral pattern reports. Using your birth data (date, time, and location), it combines Eastern astrology (Saju/Four Pillars of Destiny) and Human Design systems to create a unique analysis of how you think, decide, and operate in daily life.

The report is generated by AI (Google Gemini) and delivered as a series of visual "cards" — each one covering a different aspect of your behavioral patterns.

## What BADA is NOT
- **Not fortune telling** — nothing about the future is predicted
- **Not a horoscope** — no vague daily or weekly advice
- **Not personality typing** — no putting you in a box like MBTI or Enneagram
- **Not spiritual or mystical** — framed as behavioral pattern analysis, not belief

## How it works
1. User enters birth date, birth time, and birth location
2. System calculates Saju (Four Pillars) from the birth data
3. System fetches Human Design chart from birth data
4. Both datasets are translated into behavioral patterns
5. A 10-year luck cycle is calculated
6. AI generates personalized report cards based on all the above
