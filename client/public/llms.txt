# BADA (bada.one)

> A 5-minute self-discovery analysis that reveals how your mind actually works.

## What it is
BADA generates a personalized behavioral pattern report based on your birth data (date, time, and location). It calculates your behavioral operating pattern — how you think, decide, and operate.

## What it is NOT
- Not fortune telling — nothing is predicted
- Not a horoscope — no vague daily advice
- Not personality typing — no boxes like MBTI

## What you get
- **Free:** 3 diagnostic cards (your hook pattern, mirror pattern, and blueprint)
- **Paid ($2.90):** 10 additional cards covering why your patterns exist, what they cost you at work, in relationships, and with money, your 10-year chapter, and one actionable change for this week
