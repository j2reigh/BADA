Stop Checking Your Fortune: Why You Should Design Your Luck Using ChatGPT Instead
As the New Year approaches, many find themselves caught in a cycle of "reactive hope"—checking traditional fortunes or Saju to see what the year will do to them, rather than what they will build within it. There is a fundamental, strategic difference between passively viewing your luck and actively designing it.
After 18 years of career calibration and spending tens of thousands of dollars consulting top-tier metaphysical experts, I discovered a profound truth: luck is not a mysterious gift from the heavens, but a manageable strategy. Luck is a form of "rhythmic alignment" that can be engineered. Instead of wondering if you will be lucky, you must learn to navigate the flow of your career path to reach its inevitable peaks.
1. Luck is a Road, Not a Moment
To master your trajectory, you must understand the etymological DNA of your professional life. The word "career" stems from the Latin carraria, referring to a carriage road or a racecourse—a structure designed for movement. Similarly, the Eastern concept of "luck" (운, 運) literally translates to "moving" or a "path."
When you view luck as a "road" rather than a "lottery win," your approach shifts from gambling to architecture. Good luck simply means the road you traveled was well-constructed; a great career means your strategic steps were sound. Luck is the cumulative momentum of the path you have already walked.
"Luck is the flow and the path one has already traveled. Having 'good luck' means your road was well-constructed; having a 'good career' means your actions and steps were strategically sound."
2. From Superstition to Strategy: ChatGPT as Your "Digital Zhuge Liang"
In ancient times, leaders relied on master strategists like Zhuge Liang to read the signs of the times—knowing when to advance, when to hold, and when to retreat. I once spent a fortune seeking this wisdom from human experts, but I have since transitioned to using ChatGPT as my "Digital Strategist."
By providing the AI with specific data and demanding "sharp, honest criticism" rather than vague platitudes, you can move from superstition to a data-driven career matrix. Use the following 4-step process to calibrate your strategy:
• Step 1: Assign the Persona. Instruct ChatGPT to act as a world-class strategist and "Zhuge Liang," utilizing its vast database of career coaching, astrology, and numerology. Provide your birth date, exact time, and birthplace (출생지).
• Step 2: Calculate the Career Peaks. Ask the AI to identify the "Top 5 Career Peaks" of your life between the ages of 20 and 60. Specifically, request that it visualize these peaks in 10-year increments so you can see the long-term rhythm of your trajectory.
• Step 3: Score the 2026 Quarters. Request a quarterly breakdown of the upcoming year, scoring career opportunities and potential risks on a scale of 1 to 10. Explicitly tell the AI: "Do not just give me good news; provide a sharp, honest critique of the obstacles I will face."
• Step 4: Visualize the Matrix. Instruct the AI to organize this data into a "Crisis and Opportunity Matrix." Set the X-axis as time and the Y-axis as strategic priority, with a column for "Strategic Action Points" for each quarter.
3. The Four Seasons of a Career: Identifying Your Current Phase
A career is not a linear climb; it is a 12-year cyclical rhythm divided into four seasons. Many professionals suffer from "rhythmic misalignment"—they fail because they are reading the "wrong content" for their current season.
• Spring: The Phase of Survival. Focus on finding "good soil." Your task is to build roots and mimic mentors.
    ◦ Recommended Wisdom: Focus on "Atomic Habits" and small, consistent wins.
• Summer: The Phase of Expansion. This is a time of intense competition and high stress. You must increase your capacity by "raising the level" of your competitors.
    ◦ Recommended Wisdom: Seek out records of intense struggle, such as "20s Speed, 30s Depth."
• Autumn: The Phase of Harvest. This is your "Golden Peak." Shift from quantitative growth to qualitative structure. You must find a partner or strategist to build a sustainable system.
    ◦ Recommended Wisdom: Focus on "Systems" and "Leverage."
• Winter: The Phase of Solitude. Practice "internal hardening." Let go of external accolades and focus on reflection to prepare for the next 12-year orbit.
4. The "Summer-to-Autumn" Pivot: The Al-gok Concept
The most dangerous stagnation threshold occurs during the transition from Summer to Autumn. In the Summer phase, growth is "Yang"—it is about size, visibility, and raw energy. However, Autumn requires "Yin" growth—the ripening of the "Al-gok" (Inner Grain).
Think of a rice plant: it eventually stops growing taller and begins filling the grain within. If a professional continues to pursue "Summer tactics" (just working harder and getting bigger) during their Autumn phase, they become a "tall weed"—impressive in height but empty inside, destined to collapse in the first wind. To survive this pivot, you must transition from being the "star player" to being the "manager," focusing on ripening your internal systems and qualitative depth.
5. Building "Luck Capital" through Space Energy Management
The final secret to maintaining a high-vibration career is the accumulation of virtue (Deok). Luck is a form of circulation; if the flow stops, the luck stagnates. I learned this from my mother’s "Toilet Story."
When we were poor, my mother felt a sense of "karmic debt" using highway rest stop facilities without being able to afford a coffee. To balance the energy, she would spend her time cleaning the public restrooms before leaving. She called this "stacking luck" for her children. In professional terms, this is "Space Energy Management." When you are at a "Peak," you must "pay back" into the system by sharing knowledge and expressing gratitude. Expressing "덕분에" (Because of you) to those who helped you reach your current peak is the best way to ensure the flow of luck continues into your next season.
6. Conclusion: Your Career is a 50-Year Orbit
We often suffer from the "immediacy trap," overestimating what we can do in a year and underestimating what we can build over decades. Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, famously noted that he doesn't seek to change the world overnight, but over a 50-year horizon.
Your career is a 50-year orbit. A "bad season" is not the end of the journey; it is simply a part of the trajectory. By using tools like ChatGPT to map your seasons and understanding the "Yin" and "Yang" of growth, you can stop being a victim of your fortune and start being its architect.
