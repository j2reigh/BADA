**Date:** 2026-01-15 15:30
**Agent:** Gemini
**Reviewer:** N/A (Draft only)
**Related Issue:** User request to plan an FAQ section to eliminate final doubts.

---

## 📌 Goal

To add an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section at the bottom of the landing page. The primary goal is to proactively address users' final hesitations and doubts, thereby increasing trust and encouraging them to proceed with the analysis (CTA), testing, and final payment.

---

## 📁 File to be Modified

- [ ] `client/src/pages/Landing.tsx` - A new `<FAQSection />` component will be added before the `<FinalCTA />`. (Implementation of this will require a separate approval for code changes, this plan is for content.)

## 🔧 Content: Q&A Draft

This section should be designed as an accordion, where clicking on a question reveals the answer.

### **Q1: Is this different from fortune-telling or Saju?**

**A:** Yes, fundamentally. Traditional Saju often focuses on fortune-telling. We, however, use the same foundational data—your unique birth pattern—as a tool for **data-driven systems analysis**. We don't predict your future. Instead, we decode your innate "Operating System" to help you understand your strengths and make better decisions for yourself. Think of it as psychology, not mysticism.

---

### **Q2: What is the scientific basis for this?**

**A:** Our methodology combines principles from Eastern philosophy, which can be viewed as a time-tested statistical model of human archetypes, with modern concepts from systems thinking and psychology. We analyze the energy patterns of your birth data to create a map of your psychological hardware. The BADA analysis then provides actionable strategies based on this unique blueprint.

---

### **Q3: Is my personal information (especially birth data) secure?**

**A:** Absolutely. We take your privacy very seriously. Your birth data is used only once to generate your initial report and is not stored in a way that is personally identifiable long-term without your explicit consent. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We will never sell or share your personal data with third parties.

---

### **Q4: What exactly do I get in the full, paid report?**

**A:** The free analysis gives you a glimpse of your core identity (Page 1). The full report is a comprehensive 5-page+ "Personal Instruction Manual" that includes:
-   **Your Natural Blueprint:** Your innate hardware and core strengths.
-   **Your Current OS:** A diagnosis of your current mental software.
-   **The Core Tension:** A deep dive into the specific conflicts between your hardware and software causing "energy leaks."
-   **Your Action Protocol:** A personalized, step-by-step guide with actionable strategies to achieve better alignment.

---

### **Q5: What if I have a problem with payment or don't receive my report?**

**A:** Not a problem. Please contact our support at [support@bada.so](mailto:support@bada.so) with your email address and payment receipt, and we will resolve your issue within 24 hours. Your satisfaction is our top priority.
